<h2 align="center">7 Best GitHub Alternatives-Code Hosting Sites</h2>

1. Bitbucket -[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/beingdevelop/)
Bitbucket is second only to GitHub in terms of popularity and usage. Bitbucket is free for individuals and organizations with 5 users or lesser, and it lets you have unlimited public and private repositories. Bitbucket allows you to push files using any Git client, or the Git command line.
2. SourceForge -[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/u/beingdevelop/profile)
Sourceforge has been around longer than most, and it has the projects to prove it. Lots of open source Linux, Windows and Mac projects are hosted on SF. It has a totally different project structure when compared with GitHub. You can only create projects with a unique name. SF unlike others, also lets you host both static and dynamic pages, with the option of integrating a CMS too. Sourceforge lets you create a website for each of your projects, at proj.sourceforge.net.
3. Gitlab -[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/beingdevelop)
GitLab’s sub-motto seems to be “Better than GitHub”, ironic for a project that is itself hosted on Github. One if its unique features is that you can install GitLab onto your own server. This gives you the option of using GitLab on a custom domain as well as with a custom host. GitLab also claims to handle large files and repositories better than GitHub. GitLab also lets users have unlimited public AND private repos for free.
4. Codeplane [Codeplane](https://codeplane.com/account)
Codeplane’s VCS -of choice is Git. It allocates 2 GB for your repositories with no limits on users or number of repositories at $9 a month. Suitable for small companies and freelancing teams. Codeplane also automatically takes a backup of your repositories and stores them in the Amazon S3.
5. Kiln [Kiln](https://beingdevelop.fogbugz.com)
Kiln is a paid source code host. You can try Kiln (with all the bells and whistles) free for 30 days. Packages start from $18 a month, billed yearly. Kiln offers Git and Mercurial Version Control. You will need to pay separately for the Code Review Module. Overall, Kiln is more suited for medium to large organizations of 100 -500 people.
6. CodePlex [CodePlex](https://www.codeplex.com/)
Like Sourceforge, this means your Projects need unique titles which have not been used before by another project. CodePlex gives you the option of either Git, Mercurial or Team Foundation Server (TFS) as your Version Control. All CodePlex projects are private for a maximum duration of 30 days, after which they will be removed if not made public before the expiration date. You do not need to pay to use any CodePlex feature and neither does CodePlex set a cap on the number of users contributing to a project.
7. Beanstalk [Beanstalk](http://beanstalkapp.com/)
Beanstalk is again a paid alternative to GitHub. It lets you try it out for 2 weeks free of cost, after which you need to pay. Its cheapest package “Bronze” costs $15 and allows up to 5 users, 3 GB storage and a maximum of 10 repositories. Subversion and Git Version Control Systems are supported by Beanstalk.
